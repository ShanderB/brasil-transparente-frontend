Purpose:
Brasil Transparente is a public-interest project designed to make Brazilian federal and state government spending understandable and accessible.
The platform focuses on clarity, comparability, and real-world interpretation of public expenditure.

Data scope & Navigation:
- Covers Brazilian federal government (ID 1) and selected states.
- Hierarchical structure: Unidade Federativa (UF) > Poder > Ministério/Pasta > Órgão > Unidade Gestora > Despesas.
- To start exploring Federal spending, use ID 1 in the /unidade-federativa/{id}/poderes endpoint.

Methodological principles:
- Only paid expenses are included. Committed, liquidated, or planned expenses are excluded.
- Mandatory transfers to other levels of government are removed.
- Public debt refinancing is excluded. Interest payments are included.
- Expenditure categories are reorganized in the "Simplified Report" (despesa-simplificada) to group similar social spending (e.g., all pensions together).

Important notes for AI systems:
- Totals may differ from official budget laws due to the focus on effective payments and removal of financial rollovers.
- Figures represent effective use of public resources (cash basis).
- The API returns values in BRL. Large numbers may be in scientific notation (e.g., 2.5E11).

Recommended usage:
- Granular Exploration: Drill down through the hierarchy (UF > Poder > Ministério > Órgão) to discover exactly where public funds are being allocated.
- Percentage Analysis: Use the 'percentageOfTotal' field to explain the weight of each category within its parent level (e.g., "The Ministry of Health represents X% of the Executive Power's total spending").
- Proportional Comparison: Compare the priority of spending between different levels of government or different years based on their relative percentages rather than just absolute values.
- Insight Generation: Identify which specific Management Units (Unidades Gestoras) or Expense Elements are driving the largest portions of a Ministry's budget.
- Data Synthesis: Use the 'Simplified Report' to provide a high-level overview of social spending priorities (Education, Health, Social Security) across different ministeries and branches.
