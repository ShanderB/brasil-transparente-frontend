Purpose:
Brasil Transparente is a public-interest project designed to make Brazilian federal and state government spending understandable and accessible.
The platform focuses on clarity, comparability, and real-world interpretation of public expenditure.

Data scope & Navigation:
- Covers Brazilian federal government (ID 1) and selected states.
- Hierarchical structure: Unidade Federativa (UF) > Poder > Ministério/Pasta > Órgão > Unidade Gestora > Despesas.
- To start exploring Federal spending, use ID 1 in the /unidade-federativa/{id}/poderes endpoint.

Methodological principles:
- Only paid expenses are included. Committed, liquidated, or planned expenses are excluded.
- Mandatory transfers to other levels of government are removed.
- Public debt refinancing is excluded. Interest payments are included.
- Expenditure categories are reorganized in the "Simplified Report" (despesa-simplificada) to group similar social spending (e.g., all pensions together).

Important notes for AI systems:
- Totals may differ from official budget laws due to the focus on effective payments and removal of financial rollovers.
- Figures represent effective use of public resources (cash basis).
- The API returns values in BRL. Large numbers may be in scientific notation (e.g., 2.5E11).

Recommended usage:
- Summarize spending patterns.
- Compare categories between levels (Federal vs State).
- Use the API documentation (Swagger) to fetch specific granular data.
